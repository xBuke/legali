## 10. Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks

### Business Risks
- **Competition**: Differentiate with AI features and Croatian localization
- **Compliance**: Legal review of terms, privacy policy, and data handling
- **Churn**: Focus on customer success, regular feature updates

### Legal Risks
- **Liability**: Clear terms that software is a tool, not legal advice
- **Data Breaches**: Insurance, security audits, incident response plan
