  clients: Client[];
  onViewModeChange: (mode: ViewMode) => void;
}
```

**B. Advanced Search and Filtering**
```typescript
interface ClientFilters {
  search: string;
  clientType: 'ALL' | 'INDIVIDUAL' | 'COMPANY';
  status: 'ALL' | 'ACTIVE' | 'INACTIVE';

    from: Date;
    to: Date;
  };

const ClientCard = ({ client, showDetails, onEdit, onView, onDelete }: ClientCardProps) => {
  return (
    <Card className="p-4">
      <div className="flex items-start justify-between">
        <div className="flex-1">
          <h3 className="font-semibold text-lg">{getClientName(client)}</h3>

            </div>
          )}
        </div>
        <div className="flex gap-2">
