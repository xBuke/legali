## Environment Variables

Your `.env` file contains:

```env
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="dev-secret-change-in-production-12345678"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"
```

**Important**: Change `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` to a random string for production!

## What's Next? (Week 3+)

Now that Client Management is complete, here's what we can build next:

### Week 3: Case Management
- Create cases linked to clients
- Track case status and timeline
- Assign cases to lawyers
- Court dates and deadlines
- Case notes and tasks

### Week 4: Document Management
- Upload documents to cases/clients
- File viewer
- Version control
- Encryption (security)

### Week 5: Time Tracking & Billing
- Log time entries
- Hourly rate tracking
- Generate invoices
- Payment tracking

---

## Troubleshooting

### Port already in use?
```bash
# Kill the process on port 3000 (Windows)
npx kill-port 3000

# Then restart
npm run dev
```

### Database issues?
```bash
# Reset database
npx prisma db push --force-reset

# View data
npx prisma studio
```

### See the database?
```bash
npx prisma studio
```
This opens a visual database browser at http://localhost:5555
